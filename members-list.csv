I got started in a data analytics bootcamp in 2019 and a data science fellowship in 2021. I'd like to learn more about production-ready coding and programming for data scientists,working with real and big data, having more practices on deep learning, and seeing how professiionals approach data science projects. Geospatial analysis is interesting too."
